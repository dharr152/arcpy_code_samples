This folder contains a single python toolbox to be executed within ArcGIS Pro.  The tool downloads planimetric tree data of the city of boston, and generates polygons of the largest connected tree areas as specified by the user.  Users may specify the density of the desired tree corridor in the output.  The tool was developed as part of a class assignment as part of the MS in GIS program at John's Hopkins University.
